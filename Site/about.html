				<div style="padding:15px"><br /> Hi IGN! <br /> My name is Matt Elliott, I'm 22 and a senior in IT at the University of Central Florida. I have experience programming in LOTS of languages, though I'm fairly
				new at scripting. I've been an avid gamer my entire life, and grew up wanting to create them myself.
				I've been using IGN quite literally since I could use the internet, looking up cheats and codes for SNES and N64 games. You guys got me through the water temple in Ocarina of Time! I even made my own horrible cheat code website on geocities when I was 13. Gaming aside,
				I'm pretty much in love with all kinds of media. I watch alot of movies, and have lots of friends going into the film industry that keep me up to date on nearly every movie or tv show that comes out. I've also been playing the guitar
				for about 10 years, and listen to music as much as I can. I visited San Francisco for the first time last summer and I loved it. I can't wait to hear back to see if I can work out there for the summer, or maybe even for good!

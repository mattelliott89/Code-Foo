				<div class="cBox"><h1>How many ping pong balls would it take to fill an average sized school bus?</h1><br /><br />
				There are a number of questions I would ask before even beginning to answer this question. Is there anybody or anything extra on the school bus? Are we including stuffing them under the hood? Under the floor? Into the seats? Can you open the fire escape to pile a few more up to the roof threshhold? How many benches are in it? Does it have a wheelchair lift? Does the driver use a big cushion?
				After asking a plethora of questions of course my first thought is volume. Get the volume of the entire open space of the bus, and then subtract the volume of everything in it from that. Also consider that ping pong balls are
				round, and do not stack perfectly. therefore you would take the space between them, multiply it by the number of balls, and subtract that from the volume of open space as well. I figure you get something like:<br /><br />
				numBalls = [(V(main rectangular portion) + V(top arc) + V(steps in stairs)) - (V(bench)*numBenches + V(wheel well)*4 + V(driver seat) + V(steering wheel) + V(exit sign) + V(space between balls)*numBalls)] / V(ball)
